# PathFinder (A*)
Welcome to the Unity Projects! This repository contains three Unity projects that demonstrate different aspects of game development and pathfinding.
<br/><br/>


## [Maze Solving Algorithm (A*)](Assets/P1/README.md)

![untitled](https://github.com/MohsenBg/PathFinder/assets/84536899/8bdf5183-7dfc-4db2-9773-85445db3bd24) <br/>
This Unity project demonstrates a simple maze-solving algorithm. You can customize the maze, start and goal positions, and even step through the algorithm to visualize its operation.

## [Waypoints](Assets/P2/README.md)
![untitled2](https://github.com/MohsenBg/PathFinder/assets/84536899/2bc9b102-6953-4640-9511-6f7bed341af5) <br/>
The "Tank Waypoint Challenge" is a Unity project that demonstrates the use of custom waypoints for guiding tanks along predefined paths. In this project, players can observe various tanks with different movement characteristics as they navigate through a series of waypoints.

## [Waypoints With A* Algorithm](Assets/P3/README.md)
![untitled3](https://github.com/MohsenBg/PathFinder/assets/84536899/b5cb4109-f14d-435a-a8e0-1c06dfbc5ef3) <br/>
This project is a simulation of a jet and tank navigating through a grid-based environment using the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm. The goal is to find the optimal path from a starting point to a specified destination while avoiding obstacles.
