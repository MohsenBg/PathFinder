![untitled](https://github.com/MohsenBg/PathFinder/assets/84536899/8bdf5183-7dfc-4db2-9773-85445db3bd24)

This Unity project demonstrates a simple maze-solving algorithm. You can customize the maze, start and goal positions, and even step through the algorithm to visualize its operation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before running the project:

- [Unity](https://unity.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohsenBg/PathFinder
   ```

2. Open the project in Unity.

3. You can Find Project in directory Assets/P1

## Usage

1. **Customizing the Maze**

   - Open the Unity project.
   - Navigate to the Maze GameObject in the Hierarchy.
   - Customize the maze by modifying Randomize and Sizing its structure.

2. **Setting the Start and Goal**

   - Run The P1 sences.
   - Click on the Restart Button after That Unity select Random start and goal for you.

3. **Running the Algorithm**

   - Press the "Play" button in the Unity Editor to start the simulation.
   - The algorithm will attempt to find a path from the Start to the Goal.

4. **Step-by-Step Visualization**

   - While in play mode, you can use the "Push" button to advance the algorithm one step at a time.
   - Use the "Next Step" button to skip to the next significant step.

5. **Visualizing the Solution**

   - Once the algorithm has found a solution, the path will be highlighted in the maze.
